Disclaimer! This tool will not rip any textures from a game! You need to use other tools to get access to the texture. For example "Source 2 Viewer" is a great tool for this

After you have access to the textures from source 2 Hammer this will look for all VMAT material and creates a list of names and paths 
then you can use this Blender plugin which will create a material library from those textures 

You can go one step further and use my other plugin https://github.com/Conflig/source2_model_exporter which will allow you seamless workflow between Blender and Source 2 hammer. 

You can create your level or prop in blender hit export and all textures from the library will be properly displayed in hammer (If you have custom textures created just add them to the library and the name must be the same as in Hammer)
